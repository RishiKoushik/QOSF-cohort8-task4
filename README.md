Task 4 The NISQ devices

Generate the SWAP Test of the following states

1. [$\sqrt{0.3}$,$\sqrt{0.7}$] and [$\sqrt{0.6}$,$\sqrt{0.4}$]
2. [$\sqrt{0.1}$,$\sqrt{0.2}$,$\sqrt{0.6}$,$\sqrt{0.1}$] and
   [$\sqrt{0.0}$,$\sqrt{0.5}$,$\sqrt{0.1}$,$\sqrt{0.4}$]
3. [$\sqrt{0.01}$,$\sqrt{0.10}$,$\sqrt{0.12}$,$\sqrt{0.13}$,$\sqrt{0.04}$,$\sqrt{0.00}$,$\sqrt{0.35}$,$\sqrt{0.25}$] and
   [$\sqrt{0.00}$,$\sqrt{0.20}$,$\sqrt{0.20}$,$\sqrt{0.10}$,$\sqrt{0.20}$,$\sqrt{0.05}$,$\sqrt{0.05}$,$\sqrt{0.20}$]

and apply a depolarization in a qubit gate error from 0.01 to 0.50, you consider step size and evaluate, explain the limit, capabilities or improvements that the computer has, make plots, number of gates, identify in your view what the limiting factor is and how it can be improved if so.
